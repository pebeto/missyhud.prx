# missyhud.prx
Long time ago, when I was a little kid, I used to play a lot of games on my
PSP. In my time at the university I abandoned it in my office drawer. Years later, as part of the Glorious PC Gaming Master Race,
a HUD is something always necessary for me.
Not long ago, my PSP was reborn from the ashes, and I haven't found a plugin
that meets my metric needs. Here it is.

**missyhud.prx** is a plugin to display a simple HUD.
